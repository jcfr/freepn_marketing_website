-   [Getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting started

-   First, ensure that node.js, npm, and yarn are installed.
-   Clone the project and use your command line to enter your project directory.
-   Run `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.

Once the packages have finished installing, it will start a new server, open up a browser to `localhost:3000/dist/index.html` and watch for any HTML, SCSS, or JS changes in the `src` directory; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically update & inject the changed file(s)!

## Development

Start developing by running `yarn run watch`.

## Deployment

Ready the site for deployment / test compilation with `yarn run predeploy`.
Deploy the site with `yarn run deploy`.

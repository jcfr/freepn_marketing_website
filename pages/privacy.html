					<p>Last updated: January 29, 2020.</p>
					<h3 id="a-privacy-policy-you-can-understand-">
						A privacy policy you can understand.
					</h3>
					<p>
						You have legitimate concerns about privacy and because
						we are in the business of helping you protect your
						identity online, we want you to know what limited
						information we do collect, and how that information is
						used when you use any of Allieae, Inc.&#39;s Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						This document (hereinafter – the “Privacy Policy”)
						explains the privacy rules applicable to all information
						collected or submitted when you access, install or use
						the Allieae, Inc. Services. All definitions and
						capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy are
						defined in our Terms of Service.
					</p>
					<p>
						By visiting FreePN.com and by accessing, installing,
						and/or using the Allieae, Inc. Services you confirm that
						you have read this Privacy Policy and that you enter
						into legally binding relationship with Allieae, Inc.
						(hereinafter – &quot;Allieae&quot;, &quot;FreePN&quot;,
						&quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;), as well as you agree
						to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with
						the rules of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the
						Allieae, Inc. Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or
						your privacy, please contact us by email
						<a href="mailto:contact@freepn.com"
							>contact@freepn.com</a
						>.
					</p>
					<h4 id="we-have-a-strict-no-logs-policy-">
						We have a strict no logs policy.
					</h4>
					<p>
						Our top priority is customer data security and therefore
						have a strict no logs policy. What does that mean and
						how can we ensure that?
					</p>
					<p>
						While other VPN services route all of your traffic
						through their own VPN servers (and some log (record)
						your data and traffic patterns), Allieae, Inc. servers
						in the FreePN network do only one thing: coordinate
						encrypted peer-to-peer network connections. FreePN
						servers help you connect with other peers in the FreePN
						network. That&#39;s it. Your web browsing traffic does
						not go through our servers, and we have no way accessing
						that information.
					</p>
					<p>
						To facilitate the coordination of peer-to-peer network
						connections, you are temporarily assigned a &#39;peer
						network ID&#39; on the FreePN network that is briefly
						stored in memory (never written to disk) on FreePN&#39;s
						coordinating servers. This is so we can coordinate your
						network connection. Once your connection to the network
						has been closed (i.e. you turn off or restart the FreePN
						service, or reboot your computer), your &#39;peer
						network ID&#39; is deleted from the FreePN servers.
					</p>
					<h3 id="personal-data">Personal Data</h3>
					<p>
						FreePN does not collect any personal information about
						you. There is no such thing as a FreePN account. We do
						not collect logs of any kind. Our goal is to protect
						your privacy and to help you remain anonymous on the
						Internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Should you provide us personal information, below are
						ways that we use the information provided:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Email address: We do not require a personal email
							address to use our Services, however, FreePN does
							maintain a mailing list and prompts for an email
							address the first time you launch the application.
							This is simply so that we can send you information
							about critical security updates and other updates
							regarding our products and service. We never verify
							your email address or associate it with you in any
							way, and you can, in fact, enter any random email
							address to satisfy the prompted dialog - such as
							<a href="mailto:fake_email@sharklasers.com"
								>fake_email@sharklasers.com</a
							>. The prompt is also entirely skippable.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						In order to maintain the VPN service, FreePN also
						processes limited technical information, which sometimes
						may be considered personal data. This information is
						used for improving the functionality and usability of
						our website and Allieae, Inc. Services. If you decide
						not to provide this limited information, we may not be
						able to provide you with the full scope of the Allieae,
						Inc. Services. Said information may include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Server load information. We monitor server
							performance in order to recommend the most suitable
							servers to our customers, and to increase the
							performance of the FreePN network.
						</li>
						<li>
							Customer service information. FreePN.com stores
							inquiries and communications with users through our
							various email addresses.
						</li>
						<li>
							Cookies. FreePN.com uses a single analytics tool to
							improve the user experience on the website: Matomo.
							We use a self-hosted instance of Matomo (a
							privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics) for
							statistical assessment and website performance
							improvement. Matomo respects browser Do Not Track
							settings, and anonymizes all IP addresses. Matomo
							may occaionally use cookies.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						You can set up warnings for every time the Site places a
						cookie in your browser, or you can choose to disable all
						cookies. You can do both through your browser settings.
						You can also set a Do Not Track setting in your browser,
						which our implementation of Matomo analytics will
						respect. Since each browser has a different procedure
						for managing cookies, look at your browser’s Help Menu
						to learn the correct way to do it.
					</p>
					<h3 id="personal-data-of-underage-persons">
						Personal data of underage persons
					</h3>
					<p>
						Persons younger than 18 shall not use the Allieae, Inc.
						Services and provide any personal data to us without the
						supervision of parents or guardians. Based on the above,
						it is presumed that any person using the Allieae, Inc.
						Services and supplying personal data to us is at least
						18 years of age. If a person younger than 18 years old
						or a person, supplying wrongful data, becomes known to
						Allieae, Inc., such person and all their data may be
						immediately and without any notice withdrawn by
						suspending their access to Allieae, Inc. Services.
					</p>
					<p>
						This Privacy Policy may be modified and updated at any
						time, at our sole discretion, for any or no reason, and
						without liability, as indicated below. The date of the
						most current wording of the Privacy Policy is indicated
						at the top of the text. We ask all users to ensure that
						they are familiar with the most current wording of the
						Privacy Policy. The amendment of the Privacy Policy may
						be communicated to you by sending an email and/or by
						publishing the updated Privacy Policy on the FreePN
						website. Please consider reviewing the Privacy Policy
						each time you use the Allieae, Inc. Services. Updates of
						the Privacy Policy come into force as of the moment when
						they are published.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may not assign or transfer your rights or
						obligations under this Privacy Policy to any third
						party.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please contact us by email at
						<a href="mailto:contact@freepn.com"
							>contact@freepn.com</a
						>
						if you have any questions on our Privacy Policy or you
						want to enforce any of your rights related to your
						privacy.

# TEST POST ONE - An exhibit of Markdown

This note demonstrates some of what [Markdown](https://www.google.com) is capable of doing.

## Basic formatting

Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A
paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become
anything else.

Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of _italics_ and
**bold** is supported. This _can be **nested** like_ so.

## Lists

### Ordered list

1. Item 1
2. A second item
3. Number 3
4. â…£

### Unordered list

-   An item
-   Another item
-   Yet another item
-   And there's more...

## Paragraph modifiers

### Code block

```
Code blocks are very useful for developers and others
```

or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a
fixed-width font.

You can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.

### Quote

> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are
> automatically indented when they are used.

## Headings

There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML
headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses
one more hash character.

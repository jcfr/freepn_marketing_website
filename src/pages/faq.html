								FreePN is the world's first and only completely
								free, fast, secure, anonymous,
								unlimited-bandwith VPN.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN works just like any other VPN - it
								protects your identity online by masking your IP
								address, preventing Internet Service Providers
								(ISPs), governments, and third-parties like
								ad-services or hackers from tracking you or
								monitoring your activity.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN can also protect you on public Wi-Fi
								networks, unblock geo-restricted content,
								prevent bandwidth throttling by ISPs, and allow
								you to bypass local government censorship on
								specific apps and websites.

							<p>
								There are many reasons you should use FreePN.
								You should use FreePN if you want to be secure
								on the Internet. You should use FreePN if you
								want to protect your privacy on the Internet.
								You should use FreePN if you want to be
								anonymous on the Internet. You should use FreePN
								if you want to access geo-blocked content,
								access applications or websites censored by your
								local government, stay safe on public Wi-Fi
								networks, or stop ISPs, governments, and
								third-parties from tracking you on the Internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								You should use FreePN if you want to support
								open-source software and the future of a free
								and open Internet.

								<a

									class="faq_section_one_question_details_link"
									>VPN (virtual private network)</a
								>
								is as a tunnel from your computer to another

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								We believe that security, privacy, and anonymity
								on the Internet should be a fundamental right.
								Given this belief, an open-source, free-to-use
								tool to protect users online seemed like the
								best possible response to the challenges facing
								the Internet today.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN is dedicated to continuing the fight for
								online secuirty, privacy, and anonymity into the
								future. If the Internet is to remain critical
								infrastructure for modern life, continuing this
								fight is, and will remain, a necessity.

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								Have you ever noticed that after shopping for
								birdhouses online, you start to see a bunch of
								ads for birdhouses on other sites you visit? If
								not, try it now, then come back. This happens
								because you are being tracked online. Technology
								companies, ad services, ISPs, governments and
								more all monitor your behavior on the Internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								You might be thinking ‘well, what do I care if
								they track me?’, or ‘I have nothing to hide - so
								I have nothing to fear’. The truth is though, we
								all have things we want to keep private. Saying
								you don't care about privacy because you have
								nothing to hide is like saying you don't care
								about free speech because you have nothing to
								say. How comfortable would you be if everyone
								you knew could see exactly how much money you
								make? How would you feel if your medical
								records, emails, text messages, TV watching
								habits, or personal documents were all publicly
								available for anyone to see? What would your
								reaction be if your search and browsing history
								were sent to your friends, your family, your
								colleagues?
							</p>
							<p>
								If any of the preceding examples made you feel
								the slightest bit uncomfortable, you should care
								about privacy on the Internet, and support a
								free and open web. Privacy isn’t also just about
								what you do - it’s also who you are. And even if
								you’re not a target today, who knows what
								tomorrow will hold? One only need remember

								FreePN does prompt for an email address the

								simply so that we can send you information about
								critical security updates and other updates

								way, and you can, in fact, enter any random
								email address to satisfy this dialog - such as

								Unlike other VPN providers, FreePN's code is

								At FreePN, we believe the only security you can

								strong encryption without backdoors, and the
								like - but the truth is, unless your
								application's code is open-source, it's a black
								box and you don't really know what it's doing.

							<p>
								In short, FreePN is functionally a peer-to-peer
								VPN network. The FreePN organization itself only
								runs a coordinating server to help make
								connections between peers possible. Each user on
								our network also functions as a VPN server
								themselves for someone else on the network.

							>How is FreePN different or better than
							Tor?</summary
						>
						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								Tor consists of a network of client, relays, and
								exit nodes. Currently, Tor implements a 'three
								hop' architecture in its network routing. This
								means that information sent from your computer
								must pass through three different other
								computers before eventually reaching its
								destination, and then return via the same path.
								This process can be extremely slow, and can add
								tremendous latency to online interactions. The
								reason that Tor operates this way is to help
								obfuscate your IP address, particularly in the
								event that the exit node you are using is
								compromised. As of January 2020, the entirety of
								the Tor network comprises only ~6,000 relay
								nodes and ~900 exit nodes, so it is a very real
								possibility that a large percentage of Tor exit
								nodes have been compromised.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN takes an entirely different approach that
								attempts to solve many of the problems of the
								Tor network. By ensuring that every client in
								the network is also a server, the probability
								that a given exit node is compromised becomes
								vanishingly small. Given this, it is possible to
								make different architectural decisions (a
								'single hop', etc.) that can help FreePN be
								much, much faster and lower latency than the Tor
								network (or even any other existing VPN
								service), while still maintaining anonymity and
								security. Eventually, FreePN hopes to offer a
								number of configuration options to allow users
								to increased security past the default setting.

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								Unlike a normal VPN service, FreePN is faster,
								lower latency, open source, and above all,
								entirely free!
							</p>
							<p>
								That aside, FreePN works in a completely
								different way than a normal VPN service. Most
								VPN companies have a bunch of servers scattered
								in data centers all over the world that they use
								to route your traffic. You don't actually know
								what software is running on those servers, or if
								they're logging your traffic, or what they do
								with your data. Other VPN services are a
								black-box you simply have to trust at their
								word. FreePN is an open source peer-to-peer
								network. This means that FreePN's software is
								completely transparent - you don't have to trust
								what we say about your privacy, you can check
								for yourself! FreePN itself does not have any
								servers to route your traffic (everyone who uses
								FreePN also acts as a server); FreePN only has
								'coordinating' servers, to help make matches
								between peers -- so we couldn't log your data,
								even if we wanted to!

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								Like Wireguard and OpenVPN, FreePN is also open
								source and works with Linux. However, unlike
								Wireguard and OpenVPN which require you to own,
								manage, and run your own VPN server (and require
								technical chops like commandline proficiency,
								Linux/UNIX knowledge, and sysadmin skills),
								FreePN is super-simple to download and use. All
								you have to do to use FreePN is download and
								start the program. That's it! FreePN is a
								peer-to-peer network, so rather than the single
								IP address of your dedicated server, you
								instantly have access to thousands of potential
								IPs -- ultimately making FreePN the more
								anonymous, private, and secure choice as well.

								FreePN was made for everyone! FreePN was created
								to make online privacy accessible and

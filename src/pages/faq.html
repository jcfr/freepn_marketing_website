								FreePN is the world's first and only completely
								free, fast, secure, anonymous,
								unlimited-bandwith VPN.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN works just like any other VPN - it
								protects your identity online by masking your IP
								address, preventing Internet Service Providers
								(ISPs), governments, and third-parties like
								ad-services or hackers from tracking you or
								monitoring your activity.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN can also protect you on public Wi-Fi
								networks, unblock geo-restricted content,
								prevent bandwidth throttling by ISPs, and allow
								you to bypass local government censorship on
								specific apps and websites.

							<p>
								There are many reasons you should use FreePN.
								You should use FreePN if you want to be secure
								on the Internet. You should use FreePN if you
								want to protect your privacy on the Internet.
								You should use FreePN if you want to be
								anonymous on the Internet. You should use FreePN
								if you want to access geo-blocked content,
								access applications or websites censored by your
								local government, stay safe on public Wi-Fi
								networks, or stop ISPs, governments, and
								third-parties from tracking you on the Internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								You should use FreePN if you want to support
								open-source software and the future of a free
								and open Internet.

								The easiest way to think about a
								<a
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"
									class="faq_section_one_question_details_link"
									>VPN (virtual private network)</a
								>
								is as a tunnel from your computer to another
								computer somewhere else on the Internet, that
								then allows you to browse the Internet using
								that computer’s connection.
							</p>
							<p>
								A VPN is the quickest, most convenient way to
								protect your security, privacy, and anonymity on
								the Internet.

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								We believe that security, privacy, and anonymity
								on the Internet should be a fundamental right.
								Given this belief, an open-source, free-to-use
								tool to protect users online seemed like the
								best possible response to the challenges facing
								the Internet today.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN is dedicated to continuing the fight for
								online secuirty, privacy, and anonymity into the
								future. If the Internet is to remain critical
								infrastructure for modern life, continuing this
								fight is, and will remain, a necessity.

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								Have you ever noticed that after shopping for
								birdhouses online, you start to see a bunch of
								ads for birdhouses on other sites you visit? If
								not, try it now, then come back. This happens
								because you are being tracked online. Technology
								companies, ad services, ISPs, governments and
								more all monitor your behavior on the Internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								You might be thinking ‘well, what do I care if
								they track me?’, or ‘I have nothing to hide - so
								I have nothing to fear’. The truth is though, we
								all have things we want to keep private. How
								comfortable would you be if everyone you knew
								could see exactly how much money you make? How
								would you feel if your medical records, emails,
								text messages, TV watching habits, or personal
								documents were all publicly available for anyone
								to see? What would your reaction be if your
								search and browsing history were sent to your
								friends, your family, your colleagues?
							</p>
							<p>
								If any of the preceding examples made you feel
								the slightest bit uncomfortable, you should care
								about privacy on the Internet, and support a
								free and open web. Privacy isn’t also just about
								what you do - it’s also who you are. And even if
								you’re not a target today, who knows what
								tomorrow will hold? One only need remember

								in matters <i>today</i>.

								FreePN does not collect any personal information
								about you. There is no such thing as a FreePN
								account. We do not collect logs of any kind. Our
								goal is to protect your privacy and to help you
								remain anonymous on the Internet.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN does prompt for an email address the
								first time you launch the application. This is
								simply so that we can send you information about
								critical security updates and other updates
								regarding our service. We never verify your
								email address or associate it with you in any
								way, and you can, in fact, enter any random
								email address to satisfy this dialog - such as
								<code>fake_email@sharklasers.com</code>. This
								prompt is also entirely skippable.

								Unlike other VPN providers, FreePN's code is
								completely open-source. This means that you
								don't need to trust the claims FreePN makes
								about your security and privacy - you can verify
								them for yourself by checking out our source
								code

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								At FreePN, we believe the only security you can
								trust is security you can see. Many companies
								and VPN providers make claims about protecting
								user privacy, not logging user behavior, using
								strong encryption without backdoors, and the
								like - but the truth is, unless your
								application's code is open-source, it's a black
								box and you don't really know what it's doing.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN's code is open-source so that you can
								verify for yourself that we do what we say we
								do.

						<div class="faq_section_one_question_details_content">
							<p>
								In short, FreePN is functionally a peer-to-peer
								VPN network. The FreePN organization itself only
								runs a coordinating server to help make
								connections between peers possible. Each user on
								our network also functions as a VPN server
								themselves for someone else on the network.
							</p>
							<p>
								FreePN uses special
								<a

									class="faq_section_one_question_details_link"
									>'leaky-bucket' algorithms</a
								>
								so that you should never notice a negative
								impact on your own Internet speed while using
								FreePN. Using FreePN is just as fast (if not
								faster) than using any other paid VPN service
								available today.
